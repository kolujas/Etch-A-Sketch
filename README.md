# Etch-a-Sketch Project

A browser-based implementation of a sketchpad or "Etch-a-Sketch", created as part of The Odin Project's curriculum. This project demonstrates core JavaScript concepts, DOM manipulation, and CSS fundamentals.
git 
## Features

- **Dynamic Grid Generation:** Users can define the resolution of the drawing grid via a prompt (up to a maximum of 100x100 cells).
- **Interactive Drawing:** Hovering the mouse over the grid cells changes their background color, allowing for free-form drawing.
- **Rainbow Color Mode:** Each cell changes to a random HSL color upon interaction, creating a vibrant "rainbow" effect.
- **Reset Functionality:** A dedicated button allows the user to clear the grid completely, ready for a new drawing.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** Structured the application with semantic markup.
- **CSS3:** Styled the application and created the grid layout using **Flexbox**. Implemented a responsive design that centers the main container.
- **Vanilla JavaScript:** Powered all the core logic, including:
  - Dynamic element creation and manipulation of the DOM.
  - Handling user events with `addEventListener`.
  - Implementing the drawing and grid generation logic.
